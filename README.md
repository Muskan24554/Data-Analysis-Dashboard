#Titanic dataset dashboard (Interactive dashboard using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and uncover key insights about survival rates and passenger demographics. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes how factors like class, gender, age, family size, and embarkation point influenced survival outcomes, helping users easily explore and interpret the patterns within the data.

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
-Total Passengers: 891

-Total Survivors: 342

-Total Deaths: 549

-Survival Rate: (% survivors of total passengers)

-Passenger Counts by Age Group, Gender, Pclass

-Counts by Family Structure (Is Alone, Family Size)

## Process:
~Data Preparation: Cleaned and categorized columns (e.g., created Age Group, calculated Family Size, Is Alone).

~Dashboard Design: Selected relevant visualizations (bar, pie, donut, stacked column) and arranged interactive slicers for gender, class, age, and embarked port.

~KPI Development: Created DAX measures for instant stats (survivors, deaths, total).

~Analysis: Explored relationships between demographics, family structure, and survival using Power BI visuals.

~Insights & Refinement: Iteratively refined visuals for clarity and interactivity.

## Project Insights:
-Gender & Survival: Females had a notably higher survival rate compared to males.

-Class Impact: First class passengers had highest survival rates and higher fares; lower classes were less likely to survive.

-Age Group Trends: Adults formed the largest group; children and seniors had different survival odds.

-Family Connections: Passengers traveling with family had different outcomes than those traveling alone—patterns in survival linked to family presence and size.

-Embarked Port: Some ports had more survivors—embarkation location correlated with outcomes.

## Final Conclusion:
The interactive Power BI dashboard provides clear visual evidence of how socio-demographic and family factors affected Titanic survival odds. It highlights the pronounced survivability advantage for women, children, and first-class passengers, as well as the influence of traveling with family. These insights demonstrate the value of data visualization for transforming complex historical data into actionable understanding.
