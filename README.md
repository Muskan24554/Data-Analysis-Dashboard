#Titanic dataset dashboard (Interactive dashboard using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and uncover key insights about survival rates and passenger demographics. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes how factors like class, gender, age, family size, and embarkation point influenced survival outcomes, helping users easily explore and interpret the patterns within the data.

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
-Total Passengers: 891

-Total Survivors: 342

-Total Deaths: 549

-Survival Rate: (% survivors of total passengers)

-Passenger Counts by Age Group, Gender, Pclass

-Counts by Family Structure (Is Alone, Family Size)

## Process:
~Data Preparation: Cleaned and categorized columns (e.g., created Age Group, calculated Family Size, Is Alone).

~Dashboard Design: Selected relevant visualizations (bar, pie, donut, stacked column) and arranged interactive slicers for gender, class, age, and embarked port.

~KPI Development: Created DAX measures for instant stats (survivors, deaths, total).

~Analysis: Explored relationships between demographics, family structure, and survival using Power BI visuals.

~Insights & Refinement: Iteratively refined visuals for clarity and interactivity.
